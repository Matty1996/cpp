# cpp

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

    For this project, I was given a task: "Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.". I am to make a program that views both a 12 and 24 hour clock on a website for the client. This program also has a menu interface that allows users to choose the time increments. 

What did you do particularly well?

    For this project, I included comments for each step that does a good job at explain what is going on within the program. This is important because it makes the program easy to follow since each step is being explained in plain english. It can make the code readble to people who can not code or do not know much about coding in this language. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

    This program could use some more code that makes it more "error proof". We can add cases where if the user enters an input that is out of bounds the program still functions and displays an error message instead of just exiting the program. 
    
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

    The most difficult part of this program for me was writing functions and methods and then calling them up in the main. It took me 3 days to try and find out why I am getting an error and it was a very simple 3 second fix when I found out why. This is one of my first programs that uses methods and functions so I am still trying to get the hang of it. 
    
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

    There are many skills in this project that will be transferable for other projects. Some are the functions that break down the program into smaller manageble code. This will be used in most programs in the future. Another is the skills and information I learned about the clock and how it works. In the future, when I have to work with time and managing it, I will be able to refer to this program and use the skills I learned to help me navigate through the current project I am working on. 
    
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    There are many things I did to make the program more maintainable, readable, and adaptable. It is maintainable because the program is split into functions that each do a specific task. If the user has to go in and change something, they can more effectively find the location. The program is more readable because I added text that explains what is going on in each step. This explains the code in plain english which can help save time and headache for others reading it. I also made each variable name simple and relative to what it is. This will help the reader understand what each variable is without much thought. The program is adaptable because the user input is simple. The user needs to input 1-4 and each has a task. If the user doesnt use one of these inputs, it simply closes out.
